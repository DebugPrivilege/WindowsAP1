# Summary

This repository is dedicated to providing POCs for various Windows API functions. It is used to demonstrate the usage of Windows APIs. Each example is designed to demonstrate a specific Windows API function in a simple, but informative way. Although most functions are documented on MSDN, there is a lack of clear POC examples demonstrating the execution of code using a Win32 function.

The following tools are used within this repository:

- **Visual Studio**
- **SysInternals tools**
