# Summary

Device Management APIs in Windows allow applications to manage hardware devices, perform configuration tasks, and interact directly with drivers. This includes:

- Opening and closing device handles.
- Sending control codes to device drivers.
- Querying and setting device configurations.

Device I/O Control functions are used to send control codes to device drivers, allowing applications to request specific operations and get information from the drivers. The primary function used for this purpose is **`DeviceIoControl`**.

```
BOOL DeviceIoControl(
  HANDLE       hDevice,
  DWORD        dwIoControlCode,
  LPVOID       lpInBuffer,
  DWORD        nInBufferSize,
  LPVOID       lpOutBuffer,
  DWORD        nOutBufferSize,
  LPDWORD      lpBytesReturned,
  LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped
);
```
